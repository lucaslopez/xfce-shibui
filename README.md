# xfce-shibui

A minimal, keyboard-driven workspace navigation overlay for XFCE.

Inspired by the Japanese concept of *shibui* — the beauty of quiet, functional simplicity — this script displays a clean, non-intrusive grid of workspaces when you hold the Super key, and hides it as soon as you release. Navigate naturally using arrow keys, without ever needing a persistent panel.

## Features

- Minimal transient overlay
- Super + arrow key workspace switching
- Visual grid representation (when you want it, not before)
- No distractions. Just function.
